### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Cheulie/Cheulie** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my coding language skill, machine learning, being better than I was yesterday
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on beginner machine learning project and data sets preferably healthcare based (Pharmaceutical industry, active pharmaceutical ingredients, side effect profiles.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with best methods for learning, so much information online so easy to become overwhelmed
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about super nintendo, pharmaceuticals, pharmacy, drug manufacture, regulation and crochet!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my username is quite unique and I have managed to register myself almost everywhere apart from Gmail, where the other person with this username got there first meh!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/yourmajesty
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love maths, crochet and kizomba. I also learnt to count in binary on my fingers at the age of 11. I thought it would be useful to add large numbers. Alas I have recently discovered abacus maths and use it instead. If only such things could pay the bills! Oh and the answer to everything is 42 :trollface:
